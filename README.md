# AttendEase Development Plan

## PROJECT INITIATION
### 1. Title
- **AttendEase**
A mobile application that records classroom attendance using camera scanning.

### 2. Background of the Problem
Traditionally, attendance tracking has been in the form of manual operation in educational institutions. Accurate attendance is difficult to keep for instructors, and attendance sheets may have errors, misplacement, and fraud. Many of these methods waste class time and often fall victim to this error.

With technology increasingly being integrated into education, attendance-tracking methods have become inefficient and outdated. In this educational evolution, there is an urge for quicker, more accurate, and reliable ways of monitoring attendance. Moreover, in unforeseen circumstances, such as COVID-19, where social distancing and hybrid learning have become norms, a technological solution in tracking attendance is not beneficial but highly essential.

### 3. Purpose or Objective
The objective of the AttendEase application is to automate the students' attendance using high-end face identification. Integrating a mobile device camera with the state-of-the-art machine learning technology, the app identifies the students with precision and marks their attendance in just the wink of an eye- with no human intervention.

### Objectives:

- To provide an effective and faster attendance solution to reduce human error and save precious class time.
- To introduce higher-level facial recognition to improve security and enhance student engagement in learning.
- To enhance educational experience in making it seamless and taking away the hardship in manual attendance.

### 4. Target User
The target users for AttendEase are students and instructors within institutions of learning, specifically:

**i. Instructors/Teachers/Professors:** They will use the application for automatic attendance marking in lectures and ensure accuracy with secured data, with no manual checks.

**ii. Students:** The automated process will definitely benefit the students, providing them with immediate feedback regarding their attendance status and reducing the chances of unjustified absences.


### 5. Target Platform
This will be developed on both Android and iOS using Flutter to ensure maximum accessibility on most-used devices.

With more mobile users growing each day, the cross-platform nature of an app ensures its availability on both Android and iOS. The idea is to go mobile-first, making this experience truly intuitive and user-friendly without additional hardware or complex installations.

### 6. Features and Functionalities
Camera Attendance Marking: This important feature will provide the instructors with the accessibility to scan the classroom or students with their mobile device camera. The application automatically identifies faces and thus, marks the attendance.

Real-Time Attendance Update: Following a scan of the classroom, attendance would automatically get updated on real-time cloud-based software, accessible to instructors and students alike.

Classroom Management Dashboard: View the list of enrolled students and their attendance records over time as instructors manage their classes.

Security Features: The system is password-protected for instructor login so that not just anybody can have access to sensitive data.

## Understanding the need for AttendEase
Attendease mobile application is needed because:

**Provide efficiency:** Automate the attendance in an easy mobile app and save the most valuable time of instructors to teach the students, while simultaneously providing real-time records of their attendance to the students.

**Ensure accuracy:** Face recognition technology allows for the most accurate attendance tracking, avoiding mistakes due to mistaken identity or human error.

**Platform convenience:** Real-time attendance updates are available on both instructors' and students' mobile devices, promoting transparency and accountability.

## How we arrived at the idea:
**Research and observations**
Recent research has shown that the traditional way of conducting attendance in schools is very time-consuming and ineffective. This may result in wasting the precious time of a lesson and will ultimately affect the learning and teaching experience for both teachers and students. To resolve this issue, we deeply investigated the use of mobile technology, focusing on facial recognition systems and advanced camera features. The idea of AttendEase was born from our research efforts aimed at realizing the twin goals of time management improvement and accuracy increase of the attendance record.

**Development potential:**
AttendEase fits into the trend of digitization of classrooms and modernizing education. By automating attendance, AttendEase saves a lot of time and also makes the class environment systematic and smooth.

## REQUIREMENT ANALYSIS
**1.Technical Feasibility and Back-End Assessments**
    **a.Data Storage for CRUD Operations**
        **Database Selection:** Using Cloud Storage Firebase (Firebase Firestore).
    **b.CRUD Operations Design:**
        **Create:** Insert students records, attendance logs and face recognition data.
        **Read:** Retrieve attaendance logs, student details.
        **Update:** Allow editing of attendance records and facial recognition details.
        **Delete:** Delete records if necessary (e.g, old attendace or incorrect data).
        
**2. Ensure Compatibility with Platforms**
   **a. Smartphones (Android & IOS).**
            -Use Flutter for cross-platform development.
            -Ensure the app's performance in both Android and IOS versions
